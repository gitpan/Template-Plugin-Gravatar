Revision history for Template-Plugin-Gravatar

      - Um... considered "beta" I meant (that's what the other docs said).
      - Changed the paramter joiner from "&amp;" to "&" -- wisely
        suggested by Darren Chamberlain. Doc changes to reflect it
        too.
      - Added tests to check GRAVATAR settings in config and realized
        I wasn't getting them. Fixed it.
      - Added tests to check fatals.
      - Expanded POD quite a bit about settings.
      - Validating border now too (was already doing rating and size).

      - First stab. Considered alpha till I get some feedback and
        use testing in.
